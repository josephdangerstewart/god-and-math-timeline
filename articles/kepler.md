## Who was Kepler?

Johannes Kepler was born december 27th 1571 to Katherina and Heinrich Kepler. His childhood was recorded as less than pleasant. His mother was argumentative and his father was an immoral mercenary. He also almost died from smallpox as a child.[^1] Despite the hardships of his youth, he was offered a scholarship to the University of Tubingen where he was first introduced to the Copernicus model of the solar system despite living in a time where those who held such beliefs were persecuted by the Catholic church.[^2] Even in living in such a time, Kepler retained a strong faith and desired to see the Catholic church corrected and improved. He is most famous for his three laws describing planetary motion.

## What is Math and Truth?

In one sense, he rejected the views of Pythagoras and Plato. He believed that numbers had no real ontological existence and that only things that are counted are real. So in his view of numeric ontological reality, he was very Aristotelian. However, he aligns with Pythagoras and Plato in the sense that he believed that astronomy is based off of a certain fundamental geometric harmonies much like music. So he believed that geometry possessed a certain transcendence but more in the sense that it pointed to an intelligent creator, not that mathematics itself holds any mystical truths.[^3] Kepler is quoted saying that mathematics is knowledge that exists co-eternally in the mind of God and part of being made in His image means the ability to learn it.

> Geometry, coeternal with God and shining in the divine Mind, gave God the pattern... by which he laid out the world so that it might be best and most beautiful and finally most like the Creator.[^4]
_Johannes Kepler_

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

To Kepler, mathematics is the language God uses to define the universe. He believed that God's plan for the universe can be described in simple mathematical language. He saw his first law of planetary motion as confirmation of that belief.[^6] It seems as if Kepler did not believe that math was created by God but rather the way in which He defines the world. He saw his duty as a Christian to understand the works of God and he viewed his work in astronomy/mathematics as fulfilling this work. To him, learning and practicing math and astronomy was his way of getting closer to God. Kepler often wrote about God in his published works and often thanked Him for his insights. For this, Kepler has come under criticism by many scholars who dismissed his views as fanciful and mystical. To their credit, Kepler has published some pretty strange theories such as one posted in his work Harmonices Mundi in which he claims that the ratio between the earth's slowest speed and fastest speed confirm the reality of misery and suffering on earth.[^7]

_Johannes Kepler_

However, these critics mostly challenge his claims of revelation and some odd sounding inferences about reality but leave his academic processes and credibility untouched. Kepler believed that strictly regulated and structured scientific study was the way to know God which differed from the deeply personal and revelation based nature of the popular Catholic opinion on both spiritual and natural truth.[^8]
