## Who were the Ancient Egyptians?

Ancient Egypt was the kingdom built around the Nile from 3100 BC until 664 BC. There are three notable periods: The Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC), The Middle Kingdom (2055-1567 BC), and the New Kingdom (1567-1085 BC). During each time period, different monuments and cities were built using mathematics, with the earliest known papyrus of Mathematics coming from the Middle Kingdom. The biggest event of Ancient Egypt is the reunification of Egypt at the start of The Middle Kingdom, creating a new desire of order that expanded into religion and mathematics.

## What is Math and Truth?

The world was created by Ra, the sun god, and the moment he created it Ma’at was born from his breath. Ma’at is a concept and a goddess: she is cosmic order, balance, and harmony with the world the gods created. This coincides with how Ancient Egyptians view death: “All Egyptians anticipated becoming part of the cosmos when they died, thus the responsibility for acting in accordance with its laws was reasonable. Strict adherence to ma'at allowed the Egyptians to feel secure with the world and with the divine plan for all creation.”[^1]This understanding of the cosmos and Ma’at directly affected how Math was viewed and valued: as a means to tap into power. As Archeological Astronomer Dr. Magli notes,

> Power is of course deeply tied up with the cosmos, and so each sacred space, or sacred landscape, is also a landscape of power. In a sense, the construction of a ‘cosmovision’ is also the foundation of temporal order; that is, power.[^2]
_Dr. Magli_

Math is, therefore, used as a form of worship: to understand the stars above, to create temples and monuments to the deity Pharaohs on sacred land, and to create and follow Ma’at to secure the afterlife they desire in the stars. This created a very pragmatic view of Mathematics and to study math for its own sake was very unlikely. As long as they developed and taught the tools and mindset to run a civilization, why should they invest more time into something that is not the gods?

## What is the Relationship Between spirituality and mathematics to the Ancient Egyptians?

Math being a tool to capture order, not order itself, helped the ancient egyptians to build their tombs and temples to be astronomically orientated to different stars or the rising of the sun. Each temple is a part of one of three different astronomically orientated: The North-South Axis, to their solar civil calendar, or to the two brightest stars in ancient Egypt, Sirius and Canopus.[^3] This required huge feats of not only architecture, but astronomical calculations to have them each be perfectly lined up. This is important for religion because the pharaohs joined Osiris in heaven. The Step Pyramid has ancient texts known as the Pyramid Text describing different incantations they did for the pharaoh, here’s one of such incantation:

> This King ascended when you ascended, Osiris; his word and his double are bound for the sky, the King’s bones are iron and the King’s members are the Imperishable Stars[^4]
_The Pyramid Text_

The Step Pyramid also has holes so that the sarcophagus of the dead pharaoh can look at stars within Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, where the Ancient Egyptians considered the “Imperishable Stars” to be located.[^5]

_This picture has the eye holes for the Sarcophagus of Pharaoh Djoser to look through at the stars he became. The stars he was looking at were called the “immovable stars” because they never changed from their spot in the sky. This was also applied to the Pharaoh, who resurrected into the sky as an unmovable Deity.[^6]_

In Egyptology, it is the standard to assume the Ancient Egyptians were “‘religious beyond measure, more than any other people’” and that “most mundane of subjects, weights and measures, was apparently imbued by them with deep mystical purport”.[^7] This was applied to the religious symbol the Eye of Horus when it was hypothesized that the symbols to denote ½, ¼, ⅛, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64 looked like separate pieces of the Eye of Horus.  This showed the possible connection between one aspect of mathematical notations and mythology, but this was disproved in 2003 when the grammatical notation of the fractions were not consistent with the notation for the Eye of Horus throughout history.[^8]

While the Eye of Horus is a good example of a misattribution about Ancient Egypt by Eygptologist; Ancient Egyptians still tied a lot to religion, like their Calendar. When the Pharaoh is inaugurated he must swear to never tamper with the calendar, “keeping the year and `[Ma'at]` in perfect agreement.”[^9] This knowledge has created a conundrum within Egyptology because Ancient Egypt has a solar calendar that only had 365 days a year, with no leap year. This creates a “wandering year” in which after every four years, everything shifts one day away from where it’s supposed to be. This has led Eygptologist to wonder why an astronomical knowledgeable civilization still chooses to enact an inaccurate calendar and still keep it? As far as Archaeology is concerned, Ancient Egypt kept this Solar Calendar until conquested by the greeks. Whatever the case, it was tied to the view of maintaining Ma’at and order within Eygptian life, even though the calendar is more of a source of chaos.
