## Who was Kepler?

Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, writer and theologian who lived during the Enlightenment period. A prodigy, Pascal's father taught him math at a young age which built the foundations for a lifelong love for the subject. Most of Pascal's earliest work was successes in the sciences, but he is arguably most known for his theological and mathematical contributions.
Pascal's father broke his hip in 1646 where he was tended to by Catholic doctors. Pascal, caring for his father in the meantime, spent much time with these doctors and converted to Catholicism. It was not until 1654, however, that Pascal devoted his life to God after an intense vision where he claims to have seen "Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacobâ€¦" At this point he began his theological undertakings.
In 1659, Pascal fell extremely ill for years until he passed away in 1662. His last words were "May God never abandon me."


## What is Math and Truth?

Pascal's first mathematical work was at 16 in his Essay of Conics, where he provided two theorems. Astounding for a rigorous work especially at such a young age, Pascal's Essay formed the foundations of the mathematical field of Conics, which is today established in high school curricula. From thenceforth, he made a few more major contributions including the foundations of probability in his application of the Arithmetical Triangle in gambling as well as forming the first rigorous proof of the binomial theorem. 
Pascal's philosophy of the epistemology of math is established in his essay "Of the Geometrical Spirit," where he argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true. Thus, he understood the faith involved in mathematics, and that truths of the world we live in can be found in math, although it is not absolute.


## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

Although Pascal did not write any papers on the direct connection of math and theology, it seems that he takes on a more Platonic view of math based on his "Of the Geometrical Spirit" work discussed above. This means that Pascal viewed math to be uncreated, that math could be something of God's thoughts. The ability to know in full that axioms are true are beyond our reality, and this could be due to them being a part of God's infinite wisdom.
