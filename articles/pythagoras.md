## Who was Pythagoras?

Pythagoras of Samos was a classical Greek mathematician who lived from roughly 570 BC to 495 BC. These dates are based on the testimony of Aristoxenus (a philosopher and student of Aristotle) who writes that Pythagoras escaped from the tyranny of Polycrates (who began ruling around 538) at around the age of 40.[^1] Not much is known about the personal life of Pythagoras and what we can infer is largely just speculation. Some believe that he went to go study in Egypt for some time[^2] which would not be completely crazy to believe since Greeks valued very highly the academic wisdom of the Egyptians.[^3] Pythagoras is most famous for the Pythagorean theorem which states that the the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the hypotenuse squared but is also responsible for many developments in music theory. He also famously began a school in Croton in which he taught number theory, music, geometry, and astronomy which according to some scholars was more like a cult than a school.[^4]

## What is Math and Truth?

Pythagoras held a very high view of numbers and mathematics, giving them a divine status in his philosophy of the universe and in his school. Numbers to Pythagoras are self existent and have a real ontological existence. Pythagoras is even quoted claiming that numbers have causal powers and that all things are assimilated according to numbers. Followers of Pythagoreans were even known to pray to numbers.

> Number is the ruler of forms and ideas, and the cause of gods and daemons.[^5]
_Pythagoras_

This belief system is contained in the Pythagorean symbol of the Tetractys, a triangle figure consisting of four rows of dots, one at the top, two in the second, three in the third, and four in the fourth. This figure was very important in the mystical Pythagorean beliefs.[^6] Each of these numbers were very important in the way that numbers related to the universe. The number one was the symbol of unity and the monad, the singular beginning point of life. The number two was the symbol of duality, three the number of harmony, and four the number of completion.[^7] [^8]  These numbers also all add up to ten which is the perfect number in Pythagoreanism.[^9]

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

To Pythagoras, math holds the status of a deity. To the point where Pythagoreans would pray to the number ten.

> Bless us, divine number, thou who generatest gods and men! O holy, holy tetraktys, though that containest the root and the source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-compromising, the all-bounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the nevertiring holy ten, the keyholder of all.[^10]
_Pythagorean Prayer_

However, beyond numerical mysticism, Pythagoras and his followers revered the greek god of the sun, art, music, medicine, prophecy, and philosophy, Apollo.[^11] To the cult, learning and practicing mathematics was a part of worshipping Apollo. Also included in their worship practice is ironically ritual animal sacrifice and vegetarianism.[^12] All of this has do with Pythagoras' doctrine of reincarnation. He believed that the soul was eternal and was reincarnated in living things including animals, though he did not believe that humans would inhabit the souls of animals destined to die in a ritual sacrifice.[^13] By following the schools strict religious rules and studying mathematics, Pythagoreans believed that they could achieve the best possible reincarnation.[^14] However, at the real center of the cult was Pythagoras himself who seemed to revere himself as semi-divine.[^15]

> There are men, gods, and men like Pythagoras.
_Pythagoras_

Ultimately, the Pythagorean philosophy of mathematics, theology, mysticism, and mathematical ontological realism was carried forth for centuries, and being preserved by Plato and eventually Christianized in a sense by St. Augustine.
