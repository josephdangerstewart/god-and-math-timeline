## Who was Galileo?

Galileo was a great mathematician and inventor during the 1600s. His curiosity and thirst for knowledge led him to study astrology, which have led to his discoveries of the telescope and overwhelming evidence in favor of the Copernican theory (the idea that the planets revolve around the sun). These discoveries did not help with his relationship with the leading power at the time, the Catholic church, which was a firm supporter of the Ptolemaic theory (the idea that the sun and other planets revolved around the earth) and considered it heretical to believe in other theories. They banned Galileo from teaching on the Copernican theory and placed him under house arrest, but Galileo's dedication helped people understand that not just theology must be used to establish our understanding the universe, but that the pursuit of both theology and the sciences can help us shape our understandings of God and the universe we live in. 

## What is Math and Truth?

During Galileo's time, mathematics was not deemed worthy of study on its own. Yet, Galileo believed that mathematics was much more valuable as a field of study than his peers did. Galileo believed that mathematics (and the sciences) could and should be used to shape humanity's understanding of the universe. Galileo considered mathematics and the sciences as the leading authorities when it came to discoveries in the physical realm, and that humanity should not reject mathematical and scientific discoveries based only off the pretense that these discoveries contradict our beliefs about the universe. 

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

During Galileo's time, theology and the scriptures were considered the leading authorities on anything in the universe. However, Galileo contradicted this belief and stated that theology and the scriptures only had authority in terms of faith and morals. Galileo then went further and said that the sciences and theology do not contradict each other but are still both leading authorities in their respective fields, without one being a subset of the other. Galileo firmly believed that if the sciences and theology ended up contradicting each other in any way, then it was either humanity's interpretation of theology or the sciences that was wrong. This way, the objective reality was that the sciences and theology still agreed with each other, but the way we interpreted one of the leading authorities was skewed. Thus, Galileo said that it is our job to find where we had made the error, and correct ourselves in order to pursue God and truth.
