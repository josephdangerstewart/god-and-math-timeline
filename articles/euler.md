## Who was Euler?

Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician who was well rounded in his academic knowledge and abilities. He was born on April 15, 1707 in Basel Switzerland. And died at age 76 on September 18, 1783 in Saint Petersburg. Euler authored over 800 papers and books in the fields of mathematics and physical science. He published more than any mathematician before or after his time. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg and Berlin. Euler had a major impact on the mathematical community through his discoveries and popularizations of certain mathematical concepts. Although Euler went blind toward the end of his life, he actually produced more mathematical content during that time. This is likely due to the fact that without his eyesight he was able to spend more time on his mathematics.

## What is Math and Truth?

Although Euler spent most of his time and focus on mathematics and science, his mathematical ideas seemed to influence his idea of truth. At one point Euler said, "Logic is the foundation of the certainty of all the knowledge we acquire." His idea of logic being the foundation of certainty points to his idea that logic is the foundation of truth in general. Knowledge without logic is uncertain according to Euler, so any truth that we hold to is knowledge with logic.

> Logic is the foundation of certainty of all the knowledge we acquire. [^1]

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

Euler's father was a pastor in a Calvinist church which had an influence on Euler's view of God and the Divine. Although Euler chose to continue his career in mathematics instead of following in his father's footsteps in becoming a pastor as well, he continued to be a religious man into his adult life. As a family man, every evening he would spend time with his family reading and discussing the Bible.[^2]
