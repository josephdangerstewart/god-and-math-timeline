## Who was Aristotle?

Aristotle was student to the heavyweight philosophical thinker Plato. Born roughly in 384 BC, lived until the age of 322 BC. He was involved in many fields of study, including but not limited to mathematics, physics, logic, several fields of biology, as well as government. Aristotle was a gifted polymath that understood life from several different angles. He attended Plato's academy for a large portion of his life and left shortly after Plato died. After his time at the academy, he took to the world and established a library where he dedicated himself to write many works on several different matters. While he was a student to Plato, he differed from Plato in many ways. 

## What is Math and Truth?

Unlike Plato's belief of the forms, Aristotle thought that things that existed in this life were at some point instantiated. In other words, Aristotle's idea of a form relied on real world instances of that form in order to exist. He held the belief that people's idea of ideals were based on what is reality, rather than an ideal in a Platonic heaven. In this case, this translates into mathematics in way that Aristotle might believe that numbers were created by human thought and action. Because of this, an Aristotelian approach to mathematical truth would state that mathematics as we know it is a human construct that humankind created in order to suit the physical world. This is in contrast with Plato's idea of forms where Plato would say that mathematical objects exist apart from human action, and have been existing for as long as the world. Aristotle held a more empirical approach that claims that mathematical objects exist as humans create them. 

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

Since Aristotle has an empirical outlook towards mathematics, his approach to the divine is hinted in his empirical belief. Traditionally, Aristotle does not sanctify the divine. He tends to be critical of the gods in his context. To Aristotle, the stories of Greek gods are absurd to him, unlikely able to happen, and are false. Because of this belief towards the gods of his own culture, he would not attribute mathematical truth to any kind of divine being.
