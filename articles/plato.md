## Who was Plato?

Plato was a student to Socrates, and was a teacher to Aristotle. He was estimated to be born
sometime between 428 - 423 BC in Athens, Greece, and was thought to have created the first
western academy. He is widely regarded to have helped shape western thought as a whole.
Plato was innovative in his thought, crafting the infamous idea of Platonic realism, or the "forms"
which heavily influenced his belief of mathematics.

## What is Math and Truth?

While not a mathematician, he believed that mathematics was a necessity of the universe that
existed beyond the reach of mankind. In this sense, mathematics was eternal and separate from
the existence of man. To Plato, mathematics was abstract, and independent of mankind's
rational actions. This kind of thinking puts Plato as a realist. A realist believes mathematical
objects cannot be altered by man, as they are abstract. Realism tends to be the default position
amongst mathematicians due to the natural relation between mathematics and the physical
world, which connect in a myriad of ways that simply is not fathomable if mathematics were to
be a construct of thought rather than a system that existed alongside creation.

## What is the Spiritual and/or Theological Status of Math?

Plato's "forms" represents ideals of things that exist outside of the physical realm which are
meant to capture the pure essence of how things are meant to be in their purest state, Related
to his idea of the "forms", Plato saw mathematics not as a form, or as matter, but as existing in
some ambiguous place that exists between the forms and between matter. Although not a form,
mathematics is seen as separate from humanity's rational actions and is unchangeable in that
way. Mathematics is clearly connected to the divine in his writings. In Timaeus, Plato describes
an intelligent and benevolent creator that uses mathematics to shape the world. In this story, the
creator uses the forms in order to create the physical realm and is mathematically organized.
