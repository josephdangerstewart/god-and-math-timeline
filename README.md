# The God and Math Timeline

This project was initially started by Joseph Stewart and Mark Nguyen for BBST465 - God and Math at Biola University, taught by Dr. Jason Wilson in the Spring of 2019. The purpose of this project is to outline the historical development of the integration of math and faith and present it in an aesthetically pleasing way while remaining academically credible. The project is a series of essays highlighting historical figures who have had some influence or who's ideas represent a larger philosophy of their era. These essays aim to describe what these figures believed as well as what social, historical, and personal factors might have influenced them to believe that way.
